## What it does

Takes a topic or angle, asks Grok to read the current X discourse on that topic, and drafts a thread informed by what's trending this hour. You edit the draft in-place and copy the formatted thread to X when ready.

## Why it exists

Grok has native X access — that's xAI's unique advantage. No other LLM knows what is trending on X this hour, which arguments are ascendant, or whose take is getting traction. Threads written with that context feel native to the conversation; threads written without it feel like they were drafted yesterday. This tool puts Grok's live-context advantage directly into the composer.

## Tech stack (current scaffold)

- Static HTML + vanilla JS, served via the `serve` package for local dev.
- Grok API (xAI) with X-context enabled (planned, not yet wired).

## Future plan

A future revision may move to Vite + React with a Tailwind UI and a thin Node proxy on Render holding the xAI API key. See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for the full forward-looking design.

## Install

This tool is currently in the design phase. See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for full implementation plan.

## Run locally

The scaffold lives under `src/` and references the shared `ui-kit` via absolute `/shared/**` paths, so the dev server must serve from the repo root. The `dev` script handles that for you:

```bash
cd tools/19-grok-thread-composer
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173/tools/19-grok-thread-composer/src/ in a browser. You'll see the scaffolded shell — the composer UI itself is not implemented yet.

To run the smoke test for this workspace only:

```bash
npm test
```
