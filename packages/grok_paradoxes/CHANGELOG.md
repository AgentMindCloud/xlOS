## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added

- Initial release. Extracted contradiction-detection + authority-weighting
  from `templates/super-agents/living-narrative-fabric/orchestrator.py` in
  the `AgentMindCloud/xlOS` monorepo.
- Public Pydantic v2 types: `Source`, `Claim`, `Contradiction`,
  `ReconciliationSuggestion`.
- `ContradictionDetector` with `detect(claims)` pairwise scan and
  `summary(contradictions)` aggregation, plus a `min_severity` threshold
  argument (`"minor" | "moderate" | "major"`).
- `weight_authorities(claims)` reconciler that prefers the claim with the
  highest `source.authority * claim.confidence` product; deterministic tie
  breaks on `timestamp` then `source.name`.
- Three runnable examples under `examples/` covering two-source
  contradictions, authority-weighted reconciliation, and three-way
  consensus.
- Apache 2.0 license, Python 3.10+ support, `py.typed` marker for downstream
  type-checkers.
