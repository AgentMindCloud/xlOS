# grok-paradoxes — examples


Three runnable scripts that exercise every public symbol in the
`grok_paradoxes` package. Each script is standalone — no shared
fixtures, no hidden state, no network calls. Run any one of them in
isolation to verify your install.

## Index

| # | Script | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | [`01_two_source_contradiction.py`](01_two_source_contradiction.py) | Two sources, two prices for the same asset, similar confidence. The detector surfaces the disagreement at `severity="minor"` instead of silently picking one. |
| 02 | [`02_authority_weighted_reconciliation.py`](02_authority_weighted_reconciliation.py) | High-authority SEC filing vs. low-authority rumor account on revenue. `weight_authorities` returns a `ReconciliationSuggestion` preferring the filing, with rationale and a positive `confidence_delta`. |
| 03 | [`03_three_way_consensus.py`](03_three_way_consensus.py) | Three independent sources agree on a CPI rate. The detector returns zero contradictions and the `summary` helper reports an empty bucket — the consensus signal. |

## Running

Install the package first (from the monorepo root):

```powershell
python -m pip install -e packages/grok-paradoxes/
```

Or from PyPI:

```powershell
python -m pip install grok-paradoxes
```

Then run any example directly with Python:

```powershell
python packages/grok-paradoxes/examples/01_two_source_contradiction.py
python packages/grok-paradoxes/examples/02_authority_weighted_reconciliation.py
python packages/grok-paradoxes/examples/03_three_way_consensus.py
```

Each script prints its findings to stdout and exits 0 on success.
