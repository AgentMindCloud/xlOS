"""Multi-authority reconciliation for grok-paradoxes.


This module provides :func:`weight_authorities`, a pure-Python helper that
ranks a collection of :class:`Claim` objects by their composite
``authority * confidence`` score and returns a single
:class:`ReconciliationSuggestion`.

The function is deliberately advisory. Per the Living Narrative Fabric
Constitution, contradictions are surfaced and never silently resolved; a
reconciliation suggestion is one defensible default that callers can
attach to a UI cell or downstream aggregator while still surfacing the
losing claims alongside it.

Algorithm
---------
1. Group the input claims by ``(subject, predicate)``.
2. If the input contains exactly one such group, use it directly. If it
   contains more than one, the largest group (most claims) is selected;
   ties are broken by the group whose top-scoring claim has the highest
   composite score so the suggestion is deterministic.
3. Within the selected group, score every claim as
   ``source.authority * confidence`` and keep the highest-scoring claim.
4. Compute ``confidence_delta`` as the gap between the top score and the
   next-best score in the same group, clamped to ``[0.0, 1.0]``. When the
   group contains only one claim the gap is ``1.0`` (no rival to compare).
5. Compose a short audit-friendly rationale that names the preferred
   source, the score, and the delta so downstream readers can audit the
   decision.

The function performs no I/O, makes no network calls, and is safe to call
from any thread; it produces the same output for the same input every
time.
