"""Contradiction detection across multi-source claim sets.


The :class:`ContradictionDetector` groups claims by ``(subject, predicate)``
and flags every pair that asserts a different ``value``. Severity is
derived from two normalised components — the spread in source authority
and the spread in claim confidence — and bucketed into a closed literal
set (``minor`` / ``moderate`` / ``major``).

The detector is deliberately pure: it performs no I/O, makes no network
calls, and never silently picks a winner. Both sides of every disagreement
are returned so the caller can surface them verbatim.
