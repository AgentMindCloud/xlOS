"""Core Pydantic v2 types for grok-paradoxes.


These types are intentionally minimal and self-contained: no I/O, no
network, no implicit defaults beyond what is required for ergonomic use.
Every model uses ``model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`` so that
typos in caller code surface as validation errors rather than silently
ignored fields. Severity is restricted to a literal set so downstream
filters can rely on a closed enumeration.
